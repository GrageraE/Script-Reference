# [Script Reference](https://cosmoxdd.github.io/Script-Reference/)

This website is very similar to: [Unity C# Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) or [Cplusplus Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/).

# Why?

I'm creating this because is very useful build an application with information like functions or examples.
